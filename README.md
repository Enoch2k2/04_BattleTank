## About BattleTank
Battle tank is a course by Ben Tristram that I took in order to learn more advanced C++ programming and game design for Unreal at [https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4). Highly suggested if you want to learn how to program in C++ and how to use the Unreal Engine 4.
